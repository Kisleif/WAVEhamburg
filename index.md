# WAVE Hamburg Seismic Network

## About WAVE

The WAVE initiative investigates and designs a seismic and geo-acoustic measurement network in and around the Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld. WAVE is a unique and innovative infrastructure for geophysics, physics, and especially for large-scale research facilities. The network makes extensive use of modern seismic sensors, particularly distributed acoustic sensing (DAS)&#8203;:citation[oaicite:13]{index=13}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:12]{index=12}&#8203;.

## Projects and Research

### Proof of Concept

The WAVE concept has been tested under realistic conditions on the DESY/UHH campus in Bahrenfeld, using a 12.6 km long, existing telecommunications fiber as seismic sensors. This campaign recorded the wave field at high resolution&#8203;:citation[oaicite:11]{index=11}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:10]{index=10}&#8203;.

### Results and Analysis

- **Signals along the DAS Fiber:** The distributed acoustic sensing data was used to monitor various sources of noise and vibrations, such as cars passing nearby and environmental noise affecting accelerators&#8203;:citation[oaicite:9]{index=9}&#8203;.
- **Earthquake Monitoring:** The DAS network successfully detected seismic waves from a magnitude 7.4 earthquake in Qinghai, China, demonstrating the network's ability to monitor distant seismic events&#8203;:citation[oaicite:8]{index=8}&#8203;&#8203;:citation[oaicite:7]{index=7}&#8203;.

## Workshops and Events

- **First WAVE Workshop (May 13, 2022):** Focused on presenting results from demonstration experiments and discussing future network developments.
- **WAVE Day (July 13, 2023):** Included presentations and discussions on recent research projects&#8203;:citation[oaicite:6]{index=6}&#8203;.

## Team

The WAVE team consists of researchers from the University of Hamburg, DESY, Helmut Schmidt University, GFZ, and XFEL, collaborating on various aspects of seismic and geo-acoustic research.

- **Prof. Dr. Celine Hadziioannou (University of Hamburg):** Specializes in seismic noise analysis and monitoring changes in the subsurface&#8203;:citation[oaicite:5]{index=5}&#8203;.
- **Prof. Dr. Oliver Gerberding (University of Hamburg):** Works on reducing seismic noise in gravitational wave detectors&#8203;:citation[oaicite:4]{index=4}&#8203;.
- **Dr. Holger Schlarb (DESY):** Researches the impacts of seismic noise on accelerators&#8203;:citation[oaicite:3]{index=3}&#8203;.
