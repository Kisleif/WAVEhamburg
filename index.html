The <a href="https://indico.desy.de/event/28485/">WAVE initiative</a> investigates and designs a seismic and geo-acoustic measurement network in and around and around the Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld. WAVE is a unique and innovative infrastructure for geophysics, physics and especially for large-scale research facilities.<br>
A key element of WAVE is the widespread use of modern seismic sensors, in particular distributed acoustic sensing (DAS). This technology uses fiber optic cables as sensitive seismic sensors. It enables ground motion data to be recorded at an unprecedented spatial density over long distances, revolutionizing geophysics.

<h4>How does the city of Hamburg swing along to Taylor Swift?</h4><br>
With our WAVE glass fiber sensor network, we listen to vibrations underground with a thousand ears. 
	On July 23rd and 24th 2024, <b>Taylor Swift</b> performed at the <b>Volksparkstadion Hamburg</b>, just 2 km from our experiment! <br><br>
	
	
During the two concerts, we offered a </b><a href="https://m.twitch.tv/wave_hamburg"><b></b>livestream</b></a> of our vibration measurements. <br>
<b>We broadcasted our measurements on the Livestream on 23th of July at 18:00 -- 23:00 CEST<br> 
	and again on 24th of July at 18:00 -- 23:00 CEST.</b> <br>
	  Watch this space, we will update with more results over the next few days.  
</p>

<p>
<h4>"Swiftquakes?!" Don't worry, these are not real earthquakes!</h4>
These are tiny vibrations! You would not feel them, our measurement device is really sensitive.. <br>
You've probably felt the ground shaking a bit when a big truck passes nearby? It's the same effect, just caused by lots of happy people dancing.  <br><br>

We already knew that we should able to pick up vibrations of <a href="https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/kultur/article406448210/weil-taylor-swift-kommt-droht-hamburg-ein-erdbeben.html">concerts</a> happening in the Volksparkstadion, since we have already picked concerts e.g. by Metallica in the past. 
Lots and lots of fans jumping and dancing at the same time will cause the ground to "swing along" a bit. <br><br>

</p>

<img src="./Figures/2024_taylors_waves_livestream_shakeitoff_credit.png" alt="screenshot of Swift livestream" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">		  
 </p>

<p>
<h4>What am I looking at?!</h4>
On the livestream, you see two visualisations: <br>
A ring of <b>‘rainbow blobs’</b> and a more classic <b>‘waterfall plot’</b>. <br><br>

The <b>‘rainbow blobs’</b> show the strength of the arriving signals along the fiber but filtered for different frequency bands. So the wider a specific colour band is, the stronger are the waves vibrating in that range. They also help understand from what direction the signal is coming and help us observe along what path the waves are travelling. <br><br>


On the horizontal axis of the <b>‘waterfall plot’</b> you see the distance along the optical fibre, whereas the vertical axis represents the time. The colours then show how strongly the vibrations ‘wiggle’ fiber: yellow is stronger shaking, green is calm. So with the time passing, we can observe where along the fiber signals are arriving first and how they change as they travel. <br><br>

	<b>Wait, you're measuring all this with glass fiber? How?</b><br>
	Glad you asked! It's using a measurement principle called "Distributed Acoustic Sensing", or DAS for short. One of our team members, Wanda Vossius, explains it here, on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/C9xDPMKNRSY/?igsh=b25uMWtzMHo0d3c4"> instagram</a>.

<p> Spectrogram of the Taylor Swift concert, with some songs annotated. The brighter yellow colors indicate stronger vibrations. The 'ladder structures' shift up and down with the beats per second of the song -- this is probably a result of the fans jumping to the beat, and with that, they generate specific frequencies. </p>

		  <h4>PETRA's heartbeat during the Taylor Swift concert in Hamburg</h4>
		  The ‘rainbow blobs’ show the strength of the arriving signals along the fiber but filtered for different frequency bands. So the wider a specific colour band is, the stronger are the waves vibrating in that range. They also help understand from what direction the signal is coming and help us observe along what path the waves are traveling. <br>
This is what we measured during the entire concert with a ring of optical fiber around the PETRA III accelerator ring of DESY, sped up 100x

<h4>Can we hear the goals from the Euros below ground?</h4><br>
With our WAVE glass fiber, we listen to vibrations underground with a thousand ears. On the 5th of July 2024, when <b>France and Portugal</b> met at the <b>Volksparkstadion Hamburg</b> for the quarter finals, just 2 km from our experiment, we </b><a href="https://m.twitch.tv/wave_hamburg"><b></b>livestreamed</b></a> our vibration measureements during the match.  
When goals are scored, the celebrations cause the kind of vibrations that we can measure! We tested how sensitive our setup is and whether we can see the vibrations within the fiber.  <br>
</p>
<p>
<img src="./Figures/20240705_WAVE_EM_Livestream.png" alt="screenshot of EM livestream" style="width:100%; max-width:600px;">		  
 </p>
		  
<p>
<h4>What am I looking at??</h4>

Along our 16 km of glass fiber, we measure how much it vibrates, or 'wiggles', about every 10 meters. Each horizontal line in the image shows you how much that particular section of glass fiber is wiggling. Red means that there are strong vibrations, blue shows the bits where it's quieter. <br><br>

Starting from the top, you see how much vibrations are currently felt in DESY's PETRA tunnel. Since that tunnel is a few meters underground, there are not a lot of vibrations from car traffic, wind and such. So it's pretty blue. 
The same is true for the vibrations in the XFEL tunnel - also pretty 'quiet', and blue. <br><br>

Going further down in the image, we reach the part of the fiber that is near the surface, and roads, on the DESY/Bahrenfeld campus. The car traffic, trees swaying in the wind, and general urban activity all generate vibrations, so those sections of the glass fiber are wiggling more - and show up red! <br><br>

The whole picture is moving towards the left: that's time passing by. <br><br>

<h4>These are tiny vibrations! You would not feel them, our measurement device is really sensitive..</h4>
You've probably felt the ground vibrating when a big truck passes nearby? It's the same effect, just much weaker, and coming from lots of trucks and cars and swaying trees and other things happening at the surface at the same time. 


<h4>What happened when a goal was scored?</h4>
Before this football match, we already knew that we should able to pick up vibrations of <a href="https://www.abendblatt.de/hamburg/kultur/article406448210/weil-taylor-swift-kommt-droht-hamburg-ein-erdbeben.html">concerts</a> happening in the Volksparkstadion, since we have already picked up a concert by Metallica in the past. 
Lots and lots of fans jumping and dancing at the same time will cause the ground to vibrate a bit. <br><br>

We expected that the fans in the stadion will celebrate and jump around when a goal is scored. Indeed, we were able to pick up the football fans getting excited and jumping around during the penalty shooting. <i>We will upload some images here soon!</i> <br><br>

    <p>
    In a first step, the WAVE concept has already been tested under realistic conditions to demonstrate the feasibility and possibilities of such a network on site. 
To this end, the initiative carried out a proof-of-concept experiment on the DESY/UHH campus in Bahrenfeld in May 2021, using, among other things, a 12.6 km long, existing and continuous strand of currently unused telecommunications fiber as a series of seismic sensors. 
The wave field was recorded at high resolution,  with 1 m intervals along the entire length of the fiber. 
In the following, we summarize the development of this measurement campaign, and present a selection of initial observations.

<h2> Where is WAVE headed? </h2>
</p>

      <img src="./Figures/WAVE_evolution_stages.png" style="width:100%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Overview of the evolution stages of WAVE.  ">

<p>
Over the next years, we intend to realise a seismic and geo-acoustic measurement network in and around the <a href="https://www.sciencecity.hamburg/">Science City Hamburg Bahrenfeld</a>. WAVE will become a unique and innovative infrastructure for geophysics and physics experiments and a core asset for the Science City and its partners.
</p>

<p>
One of the long-term goals is studying the optimal placement and characteristics of seismo-acoustic sensors. On the data side of things, we will  establish  common data transmission and processing pipelines, as well as create data sharing and usage policies. 
This specifically includes the handling and storing of data according to data protection laws.</p> 

<p>
Major scientific advances are foreseen in seismology and geophysical modelling, urban systems research, real-time machine learning, and, prominently, low-latency predictions for active disturbance reduction. 
WAVE will also foster the development and integration of novel sensors, such as quantum-based inertial sensors, to continuously increase its capabilities. 
</p>

<p>
The internationally unique infrastructure and science network will establish best practices for vibration cancellation in large-scale and precision physics experiments, bringing new frontiers of precision measurements into reach, while simultaneously providing insight into the evolution of the Science City at and beneath its surface.
